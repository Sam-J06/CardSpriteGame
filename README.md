The .jar executable file has been attached in this repository.

The game uses the following input as controls:
W, A, S, D: Playable Charecter's movement.
Spacebar: Playable Charecter interaction (such as flipping cards or combat).
Escape: Starts a new round.
Mouse: Used to interact with the Game Over screen.

All testable features can be accessed through these controls and are further outlined in the Backlog, which is attached as a PDF.
